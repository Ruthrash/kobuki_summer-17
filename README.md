# Mobile robot platform using kobuki to test algorithms for Pursuit-evasion games
This setup was used to setup a platform to execute algorithms developed in pursuit-evasion differential games.
A Yujin-Kobuki base that has a Raspberry Pi3 as the processing unit, which is localised using Opti-Track motion capturing system is used.
